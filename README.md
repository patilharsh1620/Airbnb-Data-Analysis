This project is an in-depth analysis of Airbnb data carried out by me, **Harsh Patil**, as part of my data analytics learning journey. It involves leveraging MongoDB Atlas, performing data cleaning, and building interactive geospatial visualizations using Streamlit and Power BI. The goal was to derive insights into pricing trends, availability patterns, and location-based behaviors in the Airbnb marketplace.

## 1. Introduction

### Project Overview

This project explores and analyzes data from Airbnb listings, with a focus on understanding trends in pricing, availability, and geographic distribution. I used MongoDB Atlas for data storage and retrieval, and applied various visualization tools to develop meaningful dashboards and interactive visualizations.

### Objectives

The primary goals of this project were:

1. Connecting to MongoDB Atlas and fetching the Airbnb dataset.
2. Cleaning and preparing the data for accurate analysis.
3. Creating a Streamlit application with interactive maps and graphs.
4. Analyzing pricing patterns across locations, property types, and seasons.
5. Investigating availability trends throughout the year.
6. Exploring neighborhood-specific insights using geospatial data.
7. Providing a user-friendly, interactive experience.
8. Developing a dashboard using Power BI for clear and impactful insight sharing.

### Data Source

The dataset was sourced from MongoDB Atlas and includes Airbnb listing details such as host information, location, pricing, availability, and reviews.

## 2. Methodology

### MongoDB Connection and Data Retrieval

I connected to MongoDB Atlas to extract the Airbnb dataset. Custom queries were used to gather relevant information for further analysis.

### Data Cleaning and Preparation

Data cleaning included handling missing values, removing duplicates, and ensuring correct data formats. This step was essential to maintain data integrity and prepare for meaningful analysis.

### Streamlit App for Geospatial Visualization

A Streamlit web app was developed to visualize Airbnb listings on interactive maps. Users can explore pricing, ratings, and availability across different locations.

### Pricing Analysis

I analyzed how Airbnb prices change based on location, property type, and season. Charts and plots were created to help users visually understand these patterns and outliers.

### Availability Trends by Season

Booking trends and occupancy rates were analyzed across seasons. Visual tools like heatmaps and line charts were used to highlight changes in demand throughout the year.

### Location-Based Analysis

Using aggregation and filtering, I examined how listings behave across various neighborhoods. These findings were visualized through maps and dashboards to identify high-demand areas and pricing anomalies.

### Interactive Visuals

The project includes dynamic charts that let users filter and drill down into the data, enabling exploration based on region, property type, or time of year.

### Dashboard with Power BI

I created a comprehensive Power BI dashboard that combines all the key metrics and visualizations from the project. It provides a clear, interactive summary of the insights gained.

## 3. Data Analysis and Findings

### Pricing Trends

I discovered that pricing varies significantly depending on location, property type, and seasonal demand. These insights are presented via interactive visuals in both Streamlit and Power BI.

### Availability Patterns

Booking availability fluctuates throughout the year. The project highlights when and where occupancy is highest and lowest.

### Geographic Insights

Certain regions and neighborhoods showed unique trends in pricing and availability, which could be useful for hosts or travelers making informed decisions.

## 4. Conclusion

### Summary

Through this project, I gained practical experience in data cleaning, analysis, geospatial visualization, and dashboard creation. The findings offer valuable insights into Airbnb listing behavior, and the tools I developed allow users to explore and interpret these patterns with ease.

### Key Takeaways

- Proficient use of **MongoDB Atlas** for handling large datasets.
- Development of **interactive visual tools** using **Streamlit** and **Power BI**.
- Application of **Python** for data preprocessing and analysis.
- Improved understanding of **pricing and demand trends** in the short-term rental market.
